# Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis using R

## Description
This project provides an example of how to conduct stress testing and scenario analysis on a financial portfolio using R.

## Objectives
- Define various economic scenarios (e.g., high inflation, recession).
- Evaluate how these scenarios impact a portfolio's returns.
- Visualize the outcomes using a heatmap.

## Instructions
1. Ensure you have R installed on your machine.
2. Install the required R packages using the command: `install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'reshape2'))`.
3. Run the `main.R` script to conduct the analysis and visualize the results.

## Note
The assumptions and scenarios used in this project are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only.
